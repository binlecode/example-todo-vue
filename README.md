# example-todo-vue

This is a basic Vue.js todo application.

Notes during development:
* to try, use npx to avoid global @vue/cli installation
* uuidv4 is used to create todo object id

Environment:
* nodeJs: `v12.14`
* npm: `v6.13`
* @vue/cli: `v4.2.3`


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
